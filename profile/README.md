:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of CobaltCore. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS). CobaltCore is an opinionated OpenStack distribution that builds upon IronCore’s foundation to support non-cloud-native workloads, offering enhanced features like a micro-frontend self-service portal, advanced scheduling, and offering enhanced features and seamless integration with other components.

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the official website at [https://apeirora.eu/](https://apeirora.eu/).
